PrisonPolice
============

This plugin allows you to have certain block types which are "illegal" to place. It was made for use with DrugMeUp plugin on a prison server, though the illegal blocks, batons, and commands on jail (with the baton) are configurable. Police ranks are able to confiscate illegal blocks with a baton, which removes all illegal blocks placed by the now "wanted" criminal. Police rank can then find player and right click him with baton to arrest him.
